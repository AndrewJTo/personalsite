						<p>Hello, I have recently finished my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Leeds and am now looking for employment in the area of Software Engineering or anything similar, I'm quite open to ideas. When I finished university the market was a bit quiet so I worked in a <a href="#Test-Site">test site</a> for a couple of months</p>

						<p><i>Some of the places I have worked at.</i></p>
						<div>
							<h3 id="Test-Site">Covid19 Test Site - DHSC/ Mitie</h3>
							<p>When I graduated university it turned out that, due to global events, there were not as many opportunities for gainful employment as I was expecting. There were however, quite a few jobs going for testing people for this new virus, so I took a job at my local test site in Gloucester. The site was being run by the large PFI company Mitie for <del>PHE</del> the DHSC and its management really opened my eyes to the inside workings of a large Government contract.</p>
							<p>The title for this role was 'Traffic Marshal' however it involved many things, including: Telling people where to drive, checking them into the site, making test kits, instructing people on them, and collecting the kits at the end. To begin with the work was quite rewarding as you knew you were making a difference, but towards the end I grew frustrated with telling people they could not have a test because of lab shortfalls.</p>

						<p><i>Below is a non-exhaustive list of other interesting projects and things I have done in the past:</i></p>
						<div>
							<h3>CMS Web App</h3>
							<p class="text-right font-italic">2020</p>
							<p>This was originally some project that I as a PHP monolith for the Maths department at the school I went to. It is now a fully fledged CMS App with a separate <a href='https://github.com/AndrewJTo/Resource-CMS-front'>front-end</a>, written in Angular, and <a href='https://github.com/AndrewJTo/Resource-CMS'>back-end</a>; written in GO using MongoDB for record storage, S3 for object storage, and Redis for caching.</p>

						<br />
						<div>
							<h3>BSc. Dissertation - Interactive Rail Unit Schedule Visualiser</h3>
							<p class="text-right font-italic">2019-20</p>
							<p>For my final year project at the University of Leeds I wrote a Java Application to represent timetabling and unit scheduling data visually on a connected graph. The application also allowed the user to make changes to the unit scheduling data on the fly and see the result it would have on the daily service. The application used Gephi to provide interactive graphing support and Swing as a UI library. </p>

							<h3>Leeds Debating Union - Social Secretary</h3>
							<p class="text-right font-italic">2019-20</p>
							<p>Throughout my time at University I attended the debate society. In my final year I was elected to the role of social secretary, this put me in charge of putting on events for society members; this involved small things like drinks after debates and larger seasonal events.</p>
						</div>
						<br />
						<div>
							<h3>EES</h3>
							<p class="text-right font-italic">2016</p>
							<p>I took part in the Engineering Education Scheme whilst I was at school. This involved working on a project with mentors from a local engineering firm. The project was to passively track an identify people in a room, we did this using three WLAN antennae placed in different locations in a room and trilaterating observed information. We used raspberry PIs to control the antennae and wrote the program logic in python.</p>
